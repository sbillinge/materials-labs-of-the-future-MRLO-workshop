This repository contains the report of the a workshop entitled "Workshop: Scientific Opportunities and Instrumentation Needs for Next Generation Materials Genomics Based Materials Research in Materials with Long-Range Order".

It was one of a series of three workshops sponsored by NSF to garner feedback from the Materials Science community on their needs and ideas for advanced materials laboratories of the future (mLoF).  Each workshop focused on a different class of materials.  This workshop was organized around materials that exhibit long-range structural order.

The specific goals of the workshop were to address scientific needs, critical gaps in experimental capabilities, and visions for mLoFs that could help to address the gaps, specifically focusing on “Materials with Long Range Order (MLRO)”.  Input was also sought to identify training and human resource requirements that will arise in mLoFs as well as opportunities for broader participation that will be enabled by mLoFs.

The workshop was held November 16 - 17, 2022 in a remote format.

It was chaired by
Simon J. L. Billinge, Professor of Materials Science and of Applied Physics and of Applied Mathematics, Columbia University
John Mitchell, Senior Scientist, Materials Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory
Susanne Stemmer, Professor of Materials, University of California, Santa Barbara

With an Advisory Committee constituited by

Dmitri Basov, Professor of Physics, Columbia University
David Goldhaber-Gordon, Professor of Physics, Stanford University
Tyrel McQueen, Professor of Chemistry, Johns Hopkins University
Daniel Lopez, Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Penn State University

It had 52 attendees and sought feedback from the broader community through an online questionnaire.  The report contains inputs from all the attendees as well as inputs from the broader questionnaire.

The report of the discussions of the meeting is contained in this public repository.
